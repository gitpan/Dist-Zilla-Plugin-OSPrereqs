NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::OSPrereqs - List prereqs conditional on operating
    system

VERSION
    version 0.001

SYNOPSIS
    In your dist.ini:

       [OSPrereqs / MSWin32]
       Win32API::File = 0.11

DESCRIPTION
    This Dist::Zilla plugin allows you to specify OS-specific prerequisites.
    You must give the plugin a name corresponding to an operating system
    that would appear in $^O. Any prerequisites listed will be conditionally
    added to "PREREQ_PM" in the Makefile.PL

WARNING
    This plugin only works for Makefile.PL geneated by the
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MakeMaker plugin and must appear in your dist.ini
    after that plugin.

    This plugin is a fairly gross hack, based on the technique used for
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::DualLife and might break if/when Dist::Zilla
    changes how it generates a Makefile.PL.
